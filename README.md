# ModernURL - Link Management System/URL Shortener

### This project was developed to learn Python based Django framework during my Master of Computer Applications(MCA) degree course 3rd year.

Link Management System is a web application whose key concept is to allow it’s
users to create click-worthy shortened links that can be distributed easily. These links
are short and simple so the audience and easily memorize and thus get more clicks per
link. The user with minimum knowledge about computer can be able operate the
system easily. The system also produces brief result required by the management.

The project offers link management services to the user. These services makes links
efficient,short,reliable and simple with proper security. In this project we use latest
technology like python based web development framework named Django.

#### Problem Definition :-
Online link management services has been around for quite a few time but hasn’t yet
gain traction when it comes to people using these services due to a lot of
shortcomings that were there in existing systems.

The problem that we are trying to solve is how to provide enterprise users an intuitive
way to shorten their links and a single dashboard where thay can see how their links
are performing in real life.

This projects aims to also help individual users by giving them an opportunity to earn
money depending upon the traffic they can drive to their shortened links.Every
shortened link of them when opened by a visitor wil be accustomed by an short advert
of 5 seconds before visitor can redirect to the original link.

The advertisers gets an unique way to drive directed traffic to their website while
ensuring all those leads are unique and real life visitors.
